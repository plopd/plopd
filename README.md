### Hello ðŸ‘‹,

My name is **Daniel Plop**.

I am a Computer Scientist in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 
I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science (with a major in Games Engineering), 
and a masterâ€™s degree in computer science (with a major in Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning) from Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen (TUM).
